// Singly linked list: a list where elements have only a reference to next element
// A linked list is a data structure that holds objects arranged in a linear order, 
// this order is determined by a pointer in each node. 
// Unlike an array, a linked list doesnâ€™t provide constant-time access to a particular index, 
// you have to iterate through the list to find an element, 
// on the other hand, is possible to add and 
// remove items from the beginning of the list in a constant time.
